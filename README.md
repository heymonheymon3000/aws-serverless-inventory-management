# Serverless Inventory Management

## 🌟 Overview
**Scenario**<br/>
CoffeeShop Manager is a lightweight inventory management backend powered entirely by serverless services. Traditionally, coffee shop management systems rely on always-on backend servers that require manual scaling, maintenance, and high availability planning.

With CoffeeShop Manager, we take a different approach, using **Amazon API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, and CloudWatch** to create a secure, scalable, and cost-efficient architecture that can handle real-world traffic without servers.

This project aligns with the Performance Efficiency Pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework by implementing automated operations, event-driven architecture, and comprehensive monitoring.

**Your Role**<br/>
In this project, you'll take on the role of a Solutions Architect building a serverless coffee shop inventory management backend. Your goal is to design and deploy an architecture that's:

* Easy to manage and maintain
* Event-driven and serverless
* Integrated with monitoring and security systems
* Ready to handle spikes in customer traffic without downtime
* Cost-effective with pay-per-use pricing
* You'll integrate business logic, API access with fine-grained security, and deploy a frontend that connects seamlessly to your backend.
